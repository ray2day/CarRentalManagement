# CarRentalManagement
February 2022 I finished the Udemy course 'Modern Web Development with Blazor WebAssembly' (certificate of completion). Following the course a Car Rental Management-webapplication was built form scrap (learned to built a single page application client side UI using Blazor, designing a database using Entity Framework Core, learned about repository pattern and dependency injection, progressive web application, REST API and Client UI design principles, global error handeling with http interceptor, customise Blazor app layouts, authentication and authorization, Identity Core and Identity Server as also Duende). This is the complete and final code.
